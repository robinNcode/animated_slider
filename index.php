                        Creating a project thesis specific
                        to a group ensures a collective
                        effort towards achieving the
                        research objectives. It allows
                        each member to contribute their
                        expertise and collaborate in a
                        structured manner. This results
                        in a comprehensive, well-
                        researched thesis that reflects
                        the group's capabilities and
